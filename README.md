# ElasticStackDevelopersCourse

The material in this repo was built to teach students how to install ELK from scratch onto a RHEL/CENTOS VM. 
In addition, the labs are mainly designed to teach students how to:

  -Aggregate Windows Event logs to ELK
  
  -Send BRO logs from Security Onion to ELK
  
  -Build custom configuration files for Logstash
  
  ** The Notes are not perfect. The instructions in this repo are best suited for Intermediate Linux Users.
